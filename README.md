   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CSEdgeOfficial/CSEdge-Python-Programming-Internship
   ```
2. Navigate to the cloned directory:
   ```bash
   cd CSEdge-Python-Programming-Internship
   ```
3. Create a new folder with your full name to store your projects:
   ```bash
   mkdir YourFullName-with-level && cd YourFullName-with-level
   ```
4. Begin working on the tasks within your named folder.
Once you finish each task, instead of creating a pull request, push your solution to your personal Github account by following these additional steps:

Initialize a new repository on your Github account called 'CSEdge Python Programming Internship'.

1. Link the remote repository to your local project folder:
  ```
  git remote add origin &lt;your_repository_url>
  ```
2. Add and commit your solution files:
  ```
  git add .
  git commit -m "&lt;commit_message>"
  ```
3. Push your solution to your personal repository:
  ```
  git push -u origin master
  ```
